#The medication management system is designed to assist elderly individuals, like Sunita Sharma, in managing their medications effectively and improving their overall well-being. The system utilizes technology to provide guidance, support, and solutions related to medication adherence.

Key Features:

Mobile Application: The system includes a user-friendly mobile application that can be installed on Sunita's smartphone. It allows her to input her medication details, including name, dosage, frequency, and timing.

Medication Reminders: The mobile app sends reminders to Sunita's smartphone at the scheduled medication times, ensuring she remembers to take her medications as prescribed.

Medication Tracker: Sunita can mark her medications as taken within the app, enabling her to track her medication adherence and have a sense of accomplishment.

Smart Pill Dispenser: The system integrates with a smart pill dispenser that holds Sunita's medications. The dispenser is programmable to release the appropriate medications at the scheduled times, eliminating the need for manual sorting or measuring.

Caregiver Involvement: Sunita can designate a caregiver or family member who receives alerts and notifications regarding her medication adherence. This allows her caregiver to actively participate in her healthcare and provide support when needed.

How it Works:

Sunita logs in to the system using her credentials or skips the login and directly accesses the home page.

On the home page, Sunita sees the system title, a logout button, and various components, including the medication form, reminders, medication tracker, and caregiver alerts.

Sunita uses the medication form to enter her medication details, such as name, dosage, frequency, and timing.

The system sends reminders to Sunita's smartphone at the scheduled medication times, ensuring she takes her medications on time.

Sunita can mark her medications as taken within the app, keeping track of her medication adherence.

If Sunita designates a caregiver, they receive alerts and notifications regarding her medication adherence. This allows them to provide support or take necessary actions in case of missed doses or irregularities.

The goal of this project is to improve medication adherence among elderly individuals and provide them with a user-friendly and supportive system for managing their medications effectively. By using technology, the system aims to enhance the overall health and well-being of individuals like Sunita Sharma.**
